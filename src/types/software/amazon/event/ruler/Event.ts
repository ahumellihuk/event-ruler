/**
 * Prepares events for Ruler rule matching.
 *
 * There are three different implementations of code that have a similar goal: Prepare an Event, provided as JSON,
 * for processing by Ruler.
 *
 * There is the flatten() entry point, which generates a list of strings that alternately represent the fields
 * and values in an event, i.e. s[0] = name of first field, s[1] is value of that field, s[2] is name of 2nd field,
 * and so on. They are sorted in order of field name. Its chief tools are the flattenObject and FlattenArray methods.
 * This method cannot support array-consistent matching and is called only from the now-deprecated
 * rulesForEvent(String json) method.
 *
 * There are two Event constructors, both called from the rulesForJSONEvent method in GenericMachine.
 * Both generates a list of Field objects sorted by field name and equipped for matching with
 * array consistency
 *
 * One takes a parsed version of the JSON event, presumably constructed by ObjectMapper. Its chief tools are the
 * loadObject and loadArray methods.
 *
 * The constructor which takes a JSON string as argument uses the JsonParser's nextToken() method to traverse the
 * structure without parsing it into a tree, and is thus several times faster. Its chief tools are the
 * traverseObject and traverseArray methods.
